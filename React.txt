*********FreeCodeCamp React short notes*********************

 Any JSX element can be written with a self-closing tag, and every element must be closed.he line-break tag, for example, must always be written as <br />
 
 To create a component with a function, you simply write a JavaScript function that returns either JSX or null.
 
 One important thing to note is that React requires your function name to begin with a capital letter.
 
 A common pattern is to try to minimize statefulness and to create stateless functional components wherever possible. This helps contain your state management to a specific area of your application.
